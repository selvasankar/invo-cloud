## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting a Bug Report:**
* Check the **debugging guide** or documentation.
* **Search the issue tracker** to see if the problem has already been reported.

**How to Submit a Good Bug Report:**
* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots or animated GIFs which show you following the reproduction steps.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to this project? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` labels:

* **Good first issue:** issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* **Help wanted:** issues which may be a bit more involved than "good first issue".

#### Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** the project to your machine.
3.  **Create a branch** locally with a succinct but descriptive name:
    * `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
    * `git checkout -b fix/issue-number-bug-name`
4.  **Commit** changes to the branch.
5.  **Push** changes to your fork.
6.  **Open a Pull Request** in our repository.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
* Consider using [Semantic Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (e.g., `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`).

### Code Style

* Follow the standard coding conventions for the language used in this project.
* Make sure your code passes any linting checks locally before pushing.
* Add comments to your code where necessary, but try to write self-documenting code.
